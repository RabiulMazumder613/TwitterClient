## Notes

Majoirty of time spent was being able to have the login function and to have a feed on the Twitter homepage. The login was that when pressing the "Log In" button it would not load the site to enter in the Twitter account username and password. The problem was the token and it needed adjustments and then required regenerating the Consumer Keys. After using the new API Keys I was successfully able to login but my feed of tweet wouldn't load. The reason for this was in "TweetsAdapter.java" when defining the view holder my ivProfileImage was set to component tvBody not component ivProfileImage. After fixing this the tweets finally were loading.
